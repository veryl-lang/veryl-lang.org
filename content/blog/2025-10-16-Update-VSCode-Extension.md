Today we announce a new version of the Veryl extension for Visual Studio Code.
The new version has the complete same functionality as the previous version.
The only change is that the publisher is now the veryl-lang organization.

[Veryl extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=veryl-lang.veryl-vscode)

For existing Veryl developers using VS Code, the transition should be seamless:
the old release should automatically install the new extension and disable itself,
and moving forward all language features will be provided by the new extension.
Youâ€™re welcome to uninstall the original extension, which has been renamed to reflect its deprecated status.

If you have any issues migrating, please [send an issue](https://github.com/veryl-lang/veryl/issues).
