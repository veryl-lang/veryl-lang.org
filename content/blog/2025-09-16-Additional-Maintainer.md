title = "Additional Maintainer"

This project was started as a personal project of Naoya Hatta ( [dalance](https://github.com/dalance) ), and all administrator privileges are owned by him.
This status is called "Bus factor 1", it means the project stops completely if he leaves this project unexpectedly.

To resolve this issue, Taichi Ishitani ( [taichi-ishitani](https://github.com/taichi-ishitani) ) was added as a maintainer to this project.
He is the 2nd place of the contributor list, and implements many language features.

Now we share almost all privileges, including GitHub organization, veryl-lang.org domain, and so on.
This significantly reduced the risk of the project being stopped due to unforeseen circumstances.
Naoya Hatta will contribute to this project as the language owner continuously.
